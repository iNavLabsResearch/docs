## 1. Create a new batch

1. **Log in to Kupe AI**  
   Go to [https://app.kupe.in](https://app.kupe.in) and sign in.

2. **Open Outbound**  
   Click **Outbound** in the sidebar.

3. **Create a batch**  
   Click **Create Batch**.

4. **Fill in the form**
   * **Batch Name** — A clear name for the campaign (e.g. "Nov Support Followups")
   * **Description** — Short summary (e.g. "Follow-up calls for November demo requests")
   * **Phone Number** — The outbound number calls will use (must be connected to your account)
   * **Agent / Workflow** — Choose the Agent or Workflow that will handle each call
   * **Variable Names** — Comma-separated names for variables used in the agent prompt (e.g. `name`, `company_name`, `appointment_time`)
   * **Batch Size** — Maximum number of contacts to run (can match your CSV size)

---

## 2. Prepare your CSV

Your CSV must include:

* A column for **to_phonenumber**
* Optional columns for any **variables** you defined (names must match the variable names above)
* **Phone numbers** in **E.164 format** (e.g. `+1234567890`)

Tips:

* Use a header row.
* Remove extra spaces and hidden characters.
* Validate phone numbers before upload to reduce errors.

## 3. Upload CSV to the batch

1. From the Batch Calling list, open the batch you created to go to **Batch Details**.
2. Click **Upload** and select your CSV.
3. **(Optional)** Click **Template** to download a sample CSV for the correct format.
4. Map CSV columns to the fields shown (e.g. `to_phonenumber` and variable columns).
5. After selecting the file, review the preview; the UI may warn about invalid numbers.
6. Uploaded contacts appear in the **Call Recipients** table with Phone Number, Status, and Variables.

---

## 4. Launch the campaign

When the upload has been processed and the contact count looks correct:

1. Click **Launch Campaign**.

Kupe will schedule and place calls using the chosen Agent or Workflow. Each call uses the variables from the CSV for personalization.

---

## Tips and validations

* Use **E.164** phone format (`+<countrycode><number>`).
* If rows are rejected, download the error report or fix the CSV and re-upload only failed rows.
* Test with a small **batch size** (e.g. 10) first to verify agent behavior.
