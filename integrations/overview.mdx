# Integrations Overview

Integrations let your agents perform richer, more intelligent actions by talking to external systems.

Kupe integrations are **quick to set up**: choose a type, connect, and your agents can use the new capabilities without extra code. That gives you a **single integration layer** for voice agents to read data and run actions in real time.

## Unified setup

From the **Integrations** area in the dashboard:

1. Choose the integration type (MCP or HTTP).
2. Click **Connect** (or follow the provider’s sign-in flow).
3. After authorization, the integration appears in your list.

Once connected, the provider’s tools or endpoints are available to your agents — for example to fetch data, send updates, or call third-party APIs. This works for **pre-built integrations** (e.g. calendar, CRM) and **custom** setups you configure yourself.

## Custom integrations

You can add **custom** integrations by defining:

* **Authentication** (e.g. API keys, headers).
* **Endpoints and parameters**.
* **Input/output** (or schema) where relevant.

That lets your agents work with almost any external system or API.

## Output schema control

External APIs often return large payloads; not every field is useful for the agent.

With **Output Schema Control** you can:

* Define which **fields** you want in the response.
* **Trim** unnecessary data before it reaches the model or tools.
* Keep responses **focused** and efficient.

Example: for a calendar API you might keep only `event_name` and `start_time` and drop the rest. That keeps responses clean and easier to use downstream.
