MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations let your agents and workflows use external tools and data in a standard, secure way.

Learn more about the protocol: [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## Connecting MCP integrations

1. Open the **Integrations** page in the dashboard.
2. Select the **MCP** tab.
3. In the integrations list, click **Connect** for the MCP provider you want (e.g. Gmail, Zendesk, Trello).
4. Complete **sign-in** or authorization in the new tab.
5. When done, the **MCP server** appears under **Active Integrations**.

## Using MCP integrations

After connecting, you can attach MCP integrations to:

* **Assistants** — for real-time actions (e.g. send email, fetch calendar, update CRM).
* **Workflows** — for multi-step tasks that use tools.

Expand an integration card to see the tools it provides. One MCP integration can expose **multiple tools**, so you can do several actions through the same provider.

---

## Custom MCP integration

If your provider isn’t in the list, add a **Custom MCP Integration**:

1. In the MCP tab, click **Add Custom MCP**.
2. Enter:
   * **MCP Server URL**
   * **Headers** (optional) — e.g. for auth or custom metadata
   * **Timeout (seconds)** — how long to wait for the server
3. After saving, the system connects to the MCP server, **fetches the schema**, and adds it to **Active Integrations**.

You can then attach this integration to assistants or workflows like any other.

## Authorization and security

* MCP integrations use OAuth where the provider supports it.
* Credentials are stored securely and are not shown in plain text.
* You can **disconnect** or revoke access anytime from the integrations dashboard.
