# Testing

Before using your assistant in production, you can test it inside the Kupe dashboard.

You can use:

* **Web call** — Full voice conversation (STT, model, TTS).
* **Chat** — Text-only interaction with the same agent logic.

---

## Web call testing

**Web call** runs the full speech pipeline: your voice is transcribed, the model replies, and you hear the TTS response.

* On the **Configure Agent** page, use the **Start Call** control (usually on the right).
* **Save** your configuration first so the latest settings are used.
* Click **Start Call**, speak, and the agent will respond in real time.

---

## Chat testing

**Chat** uses the same agent and tools but in text only — no microphone or TTS.

* Use the **Chat** area on the same screen (e.g. bottom-right).
* Type your messages and read the agent’s replies in the chat window.
* Useful for quick checks of prompts and logic without voice.

## Tips

* Always save before starting a test.
* Use **Web call** to check real voice behavior and latency.
* Use **Chat** for faster iteration on prompts and behavior.
