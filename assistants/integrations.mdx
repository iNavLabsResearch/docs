## Overview

Integrations let your assistants talk to external systems and run real actions — from looking up data to triggering workflows. Kupe provides **MCP** and **HTTP** integrations that you can set up from the dashboard and then assign to agents.

---

## Setting up integrations

1. Go to the [Integrations](https://app.kupe.in/integrations) dashboard.
2. Choose **MCP** or **HTTP** and follow the steps to connect your provider or API.
3. After configuration, the integration appears in your **agent settings** as an option in the integrations section.
4. Select it for the assistant you want to use it with.

## Supported integration types

* **MCP integrations** — Connect to tools and APIs that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
* **HTTP integrations** — Call web APIs or internal services directly with configurable requests.

---

## Why use integrations

Integrations allow your agents to:

* Perform actions beyond plain conversation.
* Read from external data sources.
* Trigger workflows and stay context-aware.
