## Overview

Assistants can use uploaded files to answer questions, summarize content, or give context-aware answers. Upload PDFs, text files, or notes and attach them to your assistant.

## Uploading files

You can upload in two ways:

1. **From the assistant Model section**
   * Open your assistant under [Agents](https://app.kupe.in/agents).
   * In the **Model** tab, find the **Files** section.
   * Click **Add Files** and select your documents.

2. **From the Files page**
   * Go to the [Files](https://app.kupe.in/files) tab.
   * Upload files there.

Then return to the assistant’s **Model** section and select the file(s) you want from the dropdown.

## Tips

* Use clear file names so they’re easy to find later.
* You can attach multiple files to one assistant.
* Processing may take a short time after upload.
