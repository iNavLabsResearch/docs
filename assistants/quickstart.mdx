# Assistants Quickstart

Get your first voice assistant running and place a call in minutes.

In this quickstart you will:

* Create a voice assistant with a simple prompt
* Attach a phone number
* Make your first call
* (Optional) Add tools so the assistant can perform real actions

---

## Prerequisites

* Create an account at [Kupe AI](https://app.kupe.in)

---

## 1. Create an assistant

1. **Open the dashboard**  
   Go to [Dashboard → Agents](https://app.kupe.in/agents) and click **Create Assistant**.

2. **Add a system prompt**  
   Define how the assistant behaves with a short, clear prompt, for example:

   ```text
   You are a friendly phone support assistant.
   Greet the caller and offer help.
   Keep responses under 40 words.
   ```

3. **Save**  
   Click **Save** to create the assistant.

## 2. Add a Twilio phone number

1. Open [Dashboard → Phone Numbers](https://app.kupe.in/phone-numbers) and click **Create Phone Number**.

2. Enter:
   * **Phone number**
   * **Twilio Account SID**
   * **Twilio Auth Token** (from your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console))

3. Save the configuration.

---

## 3. Make your first call

When the assistant and phone number are set up:

* Call the Twilio number you added, or
* Use **Start Call** from the agent page in the dashboard.

---

> **Tip:** You can later add tools and integrations so the assistant can perform real actions — for example booking appointments, sending emails, or querying your CRM.
